# JG Issue Workflow

## When to Apply

Apply when issues (GitHub, Jira, or project tracker) are the canonical source of truth for scope and acceptance criteria.

## Core Policy

- The issue is the authoritative spec for that unit of work. Do not rely on a duplicate spec file that can drift.
- If the issue and other docs disagree, follow the issue. Escalate to human if scope is unclear.

## Start of Work

Before running the pipeline for an issue:

1. Read the issue (body and comments). Confirm acceptance criteria exist and are unambiguous. If not, stop and ask for clarification.
2. Apply project status (e.g. label `status:in-progress`). Create `.pipeline/<issue-id>/` when the pipeline starts.
3. Do not start implementation without clear AC. Use: "Unknown from repo context — confirm before implementing" when context is missing.

## During Work

- Implement only what the issue specifies. Record implementation notes or decisions as an issue comment when useful (e.g. "Agent update: ...").
- When new follow-up work is discovered, propose a new issue; do not expand scope of the current issue without approval.

## Completion

- When the pipeline finishes (PR opened and ready): post a short execution report to the issue (agents run, pass/fail, PR link). Apply done status (e.g. `status:done`).
- Reference the issue in the commit and PR. Note any issues now unblocked.

## Long-Running Spec

- Split a spec into ordered issues. Run one pipeline run per issue. Track order and dependencies (e.g. "Issue B unblocked by Issue A"). See **examples/README.md**.
