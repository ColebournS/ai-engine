# JG PR Review

## When to Apply

Apply when jg-reviewer (or a human) conducts PR reviews and you want consistent categories and merge rules.

## Finding Categories

| Category   | Meaning                                      | Merge impact           |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Blocker**| Correctness, safety, or CI failure           | Must fix before merge  |
| **Concern**| Quality, maintainability, incomplete coverage| Should fix before merge|
| **Nit**    | Style, naming, optional improvement           | Author's discretion    |

## Decision Rules

- **APPROVE**: only when all remaining findings are Nits.
- **REQUEST CHANGES**: when any Blocker or Concern is unresolved.
- Do not post APPROVE with conditions ("approve after X"); either request changes or approve.

## Review Scope

- Anchor feedback to acceptance criteria from the linked issue.
- Review only changed files. Note CI status. Do not comment on unchanged code or invent new scope.

## Review Body Format

```
## PR Audit — <short-ref>
