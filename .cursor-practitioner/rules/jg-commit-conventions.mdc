# JG Commit Conventions

## Message Format

Conventional Commits with issue (or task) ID as scope:

```
feat(ISSUE-123): short description
fix(ISSUE-456): short description
test(ISSUE-789): add tests for X
refactor(ISSUE-101): simplify Y
docs(ISSUE-202): update README
chore(ISSUE-303): config change
```

Breaking changes: use `!` after scope and `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer.

## Branch and PR

- Branch prefix: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `spike/`. Lowercase, hyphen-separated. One issue per branch.
- PR: title from primary commit; body with Summary and Test plan; reference issue(s). Check CI before declaring ready.
- Agents may open PRs; only a human may merge. No force push, no skip hooks, no direct push to main unless explicitly requested.

## Frequency

One commit per completed issue or task. WIP commits are fine locally; squash before considering the issue done.
